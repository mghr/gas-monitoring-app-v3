      <h3>Sensor Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Raitec Guardian integrates with a variety of gas monitoring sensors. These sensors are connected through serial ports using RS-232 and RS-485 protocols, which allow high-speed, reliable data transmission. The system can support up to 16 gas channels simultaneously, with real-time data logging and incident tracking.
