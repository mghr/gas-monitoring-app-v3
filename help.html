      <h3>Connecting Sensors</h3>
      <p>
        The gas sensors are connected via serial ports, using industry-standard protocols such as RS-232 or RS-485. These connections allow real-time monitoring of gases in the environment.
        The system is compatible with multiple sensor types, ensuring flexibility in usage across various industrial environments. Each sensor communicates with the central system using a unique identifier, which ensures accurate data mapping and processing.
